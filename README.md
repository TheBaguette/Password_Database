# Password_Database
It's just a PHP script to show on the shell the daily Wi-Fi password in Brisbane Central Backpackers.

## Version 1.0
How it works ?
Easy, a 'fopen' for each files linked to each days with password inside.

## Version 1.1
Add variable $path for the path of all files. It will be easier for the future to modify this variable if you decide to move directories.
